# BattleCards for iOS

For our iOS App Development final project we had to build our first non-trivial application. I chose to build a prototype for a simple 1-on-1 turn-based card battling game.

The app has all the basic gameplay logic implemented. The UI is using the standard iOS view system, not a graphics engine.

For continued development after the class was over, I moved to building this game with Unity. It's currently shelved due to needing an overhaul of the game design now that it is a mobile game instead of a physical card game.
